Divinity is the driving force behind all. Within the Realms and all things within them, Divinity infuses all. Divinity was never created, it simply was, and always has been. The power of Divinity seeks consciousness of its own, and as such forms avatars. These avatars become a piece of the power itself, catalogued and kept for further use. These identities may be killed and reformed, as Divinity can never truly be destroyed, just as no data within it may ever be truly erased.

When Divinity is whole, the majority of its power concentrated in a single being, it becomes Ashantin, the Creator. God. Ashantin is a researcher, and He works to truly understand the extent of the power of Divinity. His great and holy experiment is the splitting of the power into many different avatars. Once the experiment has concluded, He will one day reform, and Catalogue His findings.

In the split, it has become apparent that Divinity has several distinct properties. These properties are fundamental, integral parts of the power. However, when the power is split, these properties are divided unpredictably. Conscious forms of the power seem to get all or at least most of the properties, while more abstract creations like the Realms only attain a few. Each Property is listed as follows:

- Time: Time will pass, even if dilated or nonlinear.
- Position: All things have a where and a what.
- Growth: The power can grow and change.
- Preservation: The power seeks to preserve that which it sees as important.
- Order: The power likes order and organization.
- Peace: The power seeks to, at the end of it all, be peaceful.
- Freedom: The power seeks freedom from boundaries it sees as unjust.
- Ambition: The power seeks to attain its goals.
- Love: The power loves what it is and what is has, deeply.

These properties are not end-all-be-all, especially for the conscious pieces of it. Sometimes, the power must forego one or more of these traits briefly in pursuit of another.

While most pieces of Divinity are not aware, some are, and these creatures have become known as the "generations" of Divinity; they often split off pieces of their own power to create another group of conscious pieces. This is done because, even though none of them remember Ashantin, His goal of researching how Divinity works was imbued into them, and further splitting will further the research. This creates rather defined generations of Divinity, where the amount of concentrated power from Divinity increases as you climb the ladder.

A sort of "family tree" is listed below, starting from Ashantin and continuing.

He is manifest as a huge black snake, with eyes that glow bright green. He was direly wounded by the Serpentslayer, a fourth-generation pieces of Divinity.
    - Asmael: Usually manifest as a half-fish-half-man figure, Asmael typically takes the role of advisor amongst the Deepest Ones.
    - Tisrei: Usually manifest as a nondescript but large fish, Tisrei is arguably the greatest shapeshifter amongst the whole of Divinity; while it often takes extreme effort for others, he is able to do it in a fluid motion. 
    - Eshikel:
