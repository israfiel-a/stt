Not Yet Fifteen

Cassiel, a farmslave of not yet even fifteen harvests old, had been raised by slave parents enslaved in the wars out west. Those parents, however, were long gone, though Cassiel could not remember what happened to them, and did not try to. His kind were given enough water to operate and no more, with food rations much the same. Asking for more was little option; the overseers were quick to whip and beat those they saw as insubordinate. Cassiel's body, far smaller than any boy's his age had any right to be, ran exclusively on muscle memory any time he was conscious. A comforting barrier of grey covered all but what he functionally needed, and the ache of his malnourished muscles faded to numbness as his brain ground to a halt. And so, without thought, Cassiel was quiet, docile, meek. _Silent_. He did what was asked of him, no more, no less. He followed orders, no more, no less. Standing out would get him beaten. Cassiel was invisible. It kept him safe&mdash;while others were whipped bloody or even hanged for infractions that deserved no such punishment, overseers typically barely acknowledged Cassiel. Typically. Even despite his docility, Cassiel still had far more than his fair share of scars. Each ever-so-slightly raised line marring his olive skin was a jagged reminder of a terrible lesson burned into his very soul. Each step reminded his clouded consciousness of twists and sprains gone untended, of callousness and carelessness gone hand-in-hand. Despite his short stature and thin frame, Cassiel did not look his age. His hands and feet were calloused&mdash;he could not remember ever having proper shoes. His hair was haphazardly-shorn, and it hung limp around his head in a sort of matted mop. His posture was slouched, subservient, and careful, each step carried out lightly as if the ground would bite at him if he made a sound. The sound of stems crunching always made him tense on instinct, preparing for some kind of beating. No, Cassiel did not look "yet fifteen harvests old."

It was early morning, and a vibrant sunrise that Cassiel knew not how to appreciate sent streaks of color through the otherwise grey sky. Cassiel knelt beside a spikeweed plant, the pose creating a new kind of muted pain in his calves&mdash;not that he paid it any heed. Spikeweed was a squat plant, and as its name implies, a thorny one. It grows small fruits, about the size of an average palm. As he picked said fruits, Cassiel seemed robotic, each motion even and careful. A few of the plant's barbs dug into the back of his hand, and blood started leaking from the cuts. His rhythm did not break. Cassiel's hand wrapped around one of the spikefruit, a particularly ripe one. Its flesh was a sickly green, and it was bulbous in shape. Small spines were positioned in horizontal rings, which meant there was a very particular way you had to grab the fruit to prevent being pierced. All four fingers must be splayed out between the rings, and the thumb had to rest carefully against the bottom of the fruit, which had one large barb instead of many tiny ones. Due to the difficulty of its harvest, spikeweed was not what most would choose as their first produce option, but it had a property that made it incredibly good for slave-driven agriculture; spikefruit killed unless cooked. It prevented slaves from just eating that which they harvested, and as such, protected the bottom line. Slaves were cheap, but the soldiers this fruit would feed were not. The slaves were made very aware of this by their overseers, but that didn't stop some desperate souls from trying periodically. Their bodies were left in the fields to rot, the labor cost to remove them not truly worth it in the minds of the overseers. It wasn't uncommon to come across a bleached skull or shard of femur lodged in a thicket, though most remnants were blown away during storms. Cassiel, like every other slave in the fields, carried a small woven basket, no doubt handmade by another group of slaves. This basket could hold about thirty fruit, usually enough to collect the fruit of about forty plants during any one pass during peak harvesting season. However, no new storms had blown in for nearly three months, and so the now-dried plants were conserving their water by not producing as much. It had been _seventy_ plants since the last time Cassiel had emptied his basket. This new downturn in productivity created endless anger among the overseers. They themselves would be punished if the slaves did not harvest a set quota, a policy which always seemed to trickle down violently to the slaves themselves. There must always be someone for them to blame, someone _to hurt_. And when they came for you, you did not argue. You did not fight. The slaves knew this best; there was no resisting the overseers, that got you hanged. A good slave simply tried not to get in their way. 

_A good slave_. If words had the capacity to be evil, there were none so vile as those. There was not any such thing, in any sane reality, as a good slave. To be a slave was to have your innate being stolen, to be forced to do truly horrific things in the name of your overlord. To work yourself to the bone, to work yourself to _death_, because there were punishments so far removed from imagination that hanging would seem a kindness in comparison. Those who refused to work were taken to the palace dungeons, and none had ever returned. This drilled a certain attitude into the slaves; goodness had no bearing on your work. You will carry out your tasks. That was your place, and any attempt to challenge this would end in a corpse. All knew this. A "good slave" was one who worked himself to the bone, through fire and brimstone, through famine and futility, and someone, even beyond that, who took the blame. One who the harvest's failure could be pinned on. Someone who _died well_. 

Someone who died well. Someone who died well.

A violent pounding began in Cassiel's head, a sensation much more agonizing than the ever-present headache that accompanied his dehydration. As it set in, he grit his teeth and tried to keep working. Ignoring both the headache and the memories was difficult, and he was only barely managing it, but Cassiel continued picking spikefruit. Every movement became conscious as more and more of his comfort fled, the headache growing worse. That _phrase_ kept bouncing around his head _Died well_. Why did it stick out to him? He tried to ignore it as a strange side effect of the headache. He was methodic, even, silent. Methodic, even, silent. Methodic, even, _silent_. Slowly, inscrutably, Cassiel's comforting silence began to fall away. First, he noticed the rustling stems of the spikefruit. _Methodic, even, silent._ Then he noticed the way loose pebbles and fallen stems crunched under his feet as he walked. _Methodic, even, silent_. In his early youth, that sound would have delighted Cassiel. Instead, his eyes remained unfocused, completely glazing over as he tried desperately to force the sounds out of his head. There were _so many_. It was like trying to force the ocean from his lungs. So many noises, so many distractions. As he noticed the sounds, he noticed the hell he was in. He noticed the sun, and the sky, and the hurt and the pain and the _memories_. In sudden, abject terror, Cassiel completely surrendered himself. He rid himself of thought, rid himself of feeling, just keeping enough to move his body. Indeed, he was so focusing so hard on _forgetting_ that when an overseer tromped up, whip coiled in one hand, Cassiel didn't react. He just kept picking. The overseer barked an order to kneel. He just kept picking. The overseer called out again, quickly beginning to grow angry. Cassiel just kept picking. Finally, the slimy man put his hand on Cassiel's shoulder, and this touch, this invader, this unrecognized unsafety broke away Cassiel's focus from _forgetting_. It was  In the space of an instant, his haze was burned away completely, and it all came flooding in. The smell of fire screamed for attention as if a siren, roaring orange-and-red flames reflected in his mind's eye. His rhythm shattered, and a searing heat pressed against the back of his eyes. The headache returned in full force, _smashing_ as if trying to break into his skull. Cassiel spun and locked eyes with the overseer as it seemed his vision took on an orange tint. The man in front of him was tall, broad. Ordinary looking. He had a look on his face, though, one of disgust at even interacting with Cassiel, fury at the way he had been forced to _touch_ this wretch. His lips turned up in a snarl, and his eyes burned red with an anger nearly boiling over. The last nail in the coffin for Cassiel was his smell; a disgustingly overwhelming stench of alcohol, pulling a memory to the front of his mind as if hooked. 

_Fire, an inferno that consumed a shoddy wooden barracks. Blood, a trail leading to the barred front door. An iron lock that the small fingers of a child found no purchase on. The key held tauntingly in the hands of a man whose breath smelled of cheap grain alcohol. The desperate screams of a wife, the flailing small limbs of a child, the smell of singed flesh as a brand was pressed into a small chest. His chest. BLOODSIN._ 

No. No, no, no, _NO_. That wasn't how it had happened, his father had done something, something evil. That's what the overseers said, that's why the overseers burned him. For his crimes, it was justice, it was justice!&mdash;but no. It wasn't. Cassiel's father hadn't done anything but be human, as good a man as his circumstances allowed. He had simply spoken up for another slave during a senseless beating. It was brash, but his father just hadn't been able to take the cruelty any longer. For that crime, the crime of empathy, the crime of compassion, his home became his funeral pyre. His child, whom shared his skin and his face, was branded Bloodsin. For the crime of _humanity_, Casim Nehadri had been sentenced to death. There had been no&hellip;justice&hellip; Cassiel stared down at his calloused hands, and the woven basket held in them. The dark, hideous reality of his life stared him in the face. His father was dead. His mother was dead. He had the cauterized wounds of a brand on his chest. There had been no justice. There would be no justice. These realizations, like the tide of an ocean in high tide, threatened to drown Cassiel. His mouth worked silently, lungs filled with words that he had no voice to express, because they had swept away the air. The overseer still stood, some small part of Cassiel realized, mouth agape in a yell he could not hear. Time had slowed to an utter standstill as memory after memory flashed through his mind. Everything was slow, and then the wind began to pick up and the sun was covered by a cloud and feeling of his basket was too much and his body hurt and his mother was gone and Cassiel _broke_. A strangled scream tore from his throat, as if that of an animal in its death throes. Fire. Blood. An iron lock. _The_ iron lock. _His_ failure. He hadn't _done_ anything. It felt like his mind split in two, half trying to console and the other tearing it all down. _You were too small to help._ _You abandoned them._ _You were young._ _You were weak._ Why did they let him live? Oh, gods above, _WHY DID THEY LET HIM LIVE?_ That lock, twisting, clicking, always _clicking_. A constant reminder, a constant drone in the very back of Cassiel's mind, a constant reminder that made him _shake_ and _retch_ and _remember_. A sound whose presence he _loathed_. A sound whose presence he had drowned out with forgetting and ignoring and&hellip;Cassiel began to cry, shaking like a leaf gripping its branch for dear life. The overseer was still yelling, but time was as thick as molasses. _Get ahold of yourself._ Bring back the haze. Bring back the amnesia that hid the lock and hid the thoughts and hid the feelings just out of reach. Always out of reach. For his safety. For his safety.

_The fire raged. Cassiel, his hands much smaller than he remembered, his stature much shorter, screamed. He sprinted for the door, sprinted for the three men barring it, sprinted for the father within. But a woman grabbed at his tunic. "Cas, no! Stay back! For your safety!"_

For your safety. _FOR YOUR SAFETY._

Cassiel's basket finally tumbled from his shaking hands. He watched it, with a very strange sort of detached disinterest, as it collided with the ground. A new streak of dirt was left on one side, and the fruit within spilled out onto the ground what felt like a continent away. All seemed to stand still, even the wind itself. For the briefest moment, the terror faded. The guilty pit in his stomach, his shame at his inability to help his family, released. For the barest hint of a moment, Cassiel felt okay. Even the sun seemed to take a bow. _YOU DON'T DESERVE TO FEEL BETTER._ And then, violently, it all came crashing back down. The overseer was screaming, cursing, one of the fallen spikefruit had hit his foot. The man raised a hand to strike Cassiel across the face, white-hot fury in his eyes. Cassiel's entire body felt as if the skin was being peeled away slowly, over and over and over and over and OVER and OVER and&mdash;the agony overwhelmed him, and his mind desperately pulled him back into the night of his parents' death. Remembrance felt like drowning, but feeling _was_ drowning. The sunrise flipped to sunset, and Cassiel was back by the burning barracks, his small, frail, child self held back by his mother. He screamed at the men, demanding that they release his father, cursing them all to the deepest craters of damnation. The men looked at him, staring at this thin little child for one incredulous moment, and then they laughed. Vicious, predatory smiles stalked towards him, and his yells died in his throat. Cassiel found himself pressing back into his mother's chest as the men got closer. They were all still smiling those terrible, toothy smiles, showing off browned and blackened teeth surely about to fall from their heads. All three smelled intensely of alcohol, but the leader was the worst. One of them grabbed Cassiel, pulling him from his now-pleading mother's embrace. That smell of alcohol had never been stronger, choking out all other senses. Child Cassiel retched as the man slapped Cassiel across the face, saying something Cassiel couldn't remember. His mother shrieked, trying to force her way to him. It was as if all sound was muted, as if Cassiel was underwater. The only thing he could hear clearly was his mother's scream, as she was thrown to the ground, the fire her husband died in not five paces from her. One of the men pushed his boot into her throat, slurring something threatening. She just kept trying to crawl towards Cassiel. The drunk spoke again, this time angrier, pushing his boot harder into her throat. 

Fire. Blood. An iron lock. One last awful, pleading scream as all he ever knew crumbled away before his eyes. A horrible, vile choking as a boot pressed harder down onto a thin throat. And as the blow from the overseer finally landed outside the memory, cracking across Cassiel's stricken face, he heard one last struggling gasp and a final _crunch_. A whimper escaped his lips as the his last family died like a dog in the dirt. A body, olive skin like Cassiel's, lying splayed out, her clothes covered in dust. Tears still running down her face, though her eyes stared sightlessly into the sun above. Hair like Cassiel's splayed out behind her, matted and tangled. Silence fell for the briefest of moments, and then there was cruel, disgusting laughter. Laughter that became part of the background track in Cassiel's mind, the drone that consumed all. The cries of a little boy restrained and powerless. Cassiel pressed his hands to his eyes, which had begun to weep. Hands far too scarred for a boy far too young became covered in tears far too justified. The&mdash;real&mdash;overseer sneered, uncoiling his whip. It reminded Cassiel of that man, the one his father had spoken up for. Selfishly, he wished they had killed that man faster. Selfishly, he wished they had killed _him_ next. Cassiel's hands pressed harder and _harder_, trying to block out the harsh sunlight that seemed to permeate _everything_. Tying to block out the memory, the smell. Trying to block out the death, the sorrow. Trying to block out those three men, their laughs and the way they restrained him from even running to his freshly-slain mother's side. A true, inhuman shriek came from somewhere deep inside Cassiel as the first kiss of the whip left a welted line across his chest. The terror he had suppressed and forced down endlessly for nearly a decade suddenly _exploded_ to the surface. His fingers, their nails cracked and dirty, sliced through his own face as if it were paper, leaving leaking wells of red that ran like rivers. The tears and the blood became mixed, both dripping to the ground and staining the dirt. It felt as if every _fiber_ of his being was being rent apart, as if even his skin rejected the memories, as if a million million hammers were striking his skull at once. Again and again and again and again and again and again and&mdash;

_One last word escaped his mother's lips as the boot pressed down. Cassiel&hellip;_

Cassiel's eyes, at long last, flew open. But they were _wrong_, unseeing and cold in the way they regarded the world. His previously green irises were blended with an orange-red, as if copper wire ran through them. His pupils dilated and contracted wildly, as if he were having a seizure. The overseer dropped his whip halfway through his second strike, mouth agape as he regarded this new creature in front of him. Cassiel grabbed the man by the neck. In this _scum_, Cassiel saw the three men who had taken EVERYTHING from him. Those men who had stolen his family, those men who had _ruined it all_, those men who had _DENIED HIM JUSTICE_. In this _scum_, Cassiel saw a chance to rectify that which was taken from him. In this _scum_, Cassiel saw a chance for RETRIBUTION. In this _scum_, Cassiel saw a man given far, far too many second chances. People can change, but some never do. This one, he decided, never would. He gripped the man's neck tighter, strength that made absolutely no logical sense forcing the overseer to choke and gasp and struggle in an attempt to pull in air. A terrible smile played across Cassiel's cracked lips, baring his teeth in a manner almost primal. He kept gripping tighter and tighter. This was justice. No, this was more than that. This was _REVENGE_. The overseer looked into the eyes of the angel of death, and it was a little boy of not even fifteen. The Angel opened His mouth, and a voice that was not His came from His throat.

"YOU HAVE BEEN JUDGED GUILTY. THERE WILL BE NO MORE SECOND CHANCES."

A animalistic terror ensued in the man's quickly darkening mind. He struggled, trying to pry the Angel's hands off. When he realized it was futile, he began to weep. He tried to plead with his eyes as the edges of his vision began to go black. The Angel gripped tighter. The man gasped pathetically, trying time to draw in breath one last time. The Angel gripped tighter. Twisting sanguine lines had begun to form from the blood dripping down the Angel's face, quickly becoming the same orange-red as His eyes. The lines snaked down His neck, His arms, His legs, forming into a network that seemed to radiate from His heart, despite the blood's supply being His face. The long-ruined fabric of the Angel's tunic finally gave way, and its shreds dropped to His feet, just in time to see the blood-substance filling in the brand on His emaciated chest. A single glyph, a droplet with a diamond centered within it. A mark of heinous crime, a mark of _sin_. A mark of lineage.

"I AM CASSIEL NEHANDRI, AND I AM BLOODSIN."

This time, the voice was a blend of Cassiel's and the Angel's. There was a maelstrom of anger in its tone, one reflected in the Angel's eyes. As the blood touched the brand, it became thicker and almost iridescent, transforming into a powerful superset of what it once was. The lines of the substance twitched and writhed as they continued to grow, somehow working themselves into the archaic glyphs of a language long, long forgotten. There were ten characters, not counting the one burned into the Angel's chest. One on each bicep, one on each calf, one on His neck, two on His back, and a final three that ringed the Bloodsin brand. Each line was a slightly different shade, some erring closer to red while others closer to orange, though the difference was largely imperceptible to the naked eye. As the final few blood-glyphs became complete, the Angel's body began to shake. Every single muscle tensed and relaxed at sporadic intervals, as if His very soul was fighting desperately to keep itself in one piece. Atrophied tendons flexed as if mustering one last burst of strength; as if the death of a supernova was playing out in real time. Blood began to seep through the Angel's lips, and a staccato gasp shook His small body. In a final burst of strength, He snapped the overseer's neck, and let the man fall to the dirt. He was much less imposing on the ground, an expression of pain and anguish on his face, pitiful tears still welled in now-glazed eyes. As the Angel's body shook under the immense power of whatever granted Him His strength, He spoke again. 

_YOU ARE NOT READY._

A sudden, wracking cough brought the whole ordeal to a concise halt. The ancient glyphs faded and Cassiel's last vestiges of strength failed completely. His legs' fortitude finally ran dry and he collapsed. Laying in the dirt and the pebbles, fallen spikeweed spines digging into his flesh, his eyes fell shut, the sun beating on his small body. The last thing Cassiel could smell was dust. And then, he was still, still as death.

Fire. Blood. An iron lock.
