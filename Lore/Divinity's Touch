[description] A summary of the idea of being "touched by Divinity".

When a person sees Divinity in any of its conscious forms, the imprint of that form is left on their soul. This can come in many different forms, but usually it comes in the way of bright gold irises. Similar to how iris color changes when [metabolizing manifestations of Divinity]("./Chainbinding/Chainbinding"), iris color also changes when metabolizing the _imprint_ of Divinity, though this metabolization has zero actual effect on the person's capabilities.
