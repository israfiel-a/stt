[description] Details about the planet on which Bloodletter takes place.

Mihr is a planet of exactly the same size as Earth; radius, density, mass, all the exact same. However, it orbits closely to its star, a main-sequence red dwarf. This has tidally locked it, making one side completely uninhabitable due to extraordinary colds, and the other mostly tropical--a so-called "cold eyeball planet". Another problem that comes with orbiting a red dwarf star is the risk of solar flares, which would strip the atmosphere of any planet within its habitable zone. When [Nammael]("./Divinities/0C: Solons/Nammael") is killed, his Divinity is used to restrain the new star. Before his death, the star was simply an illusion created by Divinity's presence. Mihr has one huge continent surrounded by smaller subcontinent islands on the dayside, and a gigaarchipelago on the darkside.
