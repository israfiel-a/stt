### Kanahi
The Kanahi were the first race of humans ever created. They live in the mountains directly in the center of Mihr's daylight side. They speak the original language of humanity, [Kehheniim]("../Languages/Kalt/0: Kehheniim.md"). All Kanahi are fair of skin and the vast majority are stout. They have thick, curly hair&mdash;typically fairly-hued as well. No Kanahi has eyes any shade besides brown, unless [touched by Divinity]().
