Compassion Without Action

Scene begin

Two men, atop a temple.

The city beneath them, the capital of the first duchy razed in the first Reunification war, burns.

Below them, people fight over scraps of gold from statues.

Brawls turn quickly lethal.

Scene begin

The men begin talking.

One expresses caution (Ishikh) while the other calls for action (Nehandrah).

They begin to argue, Ishikh treating Nehandrah like a petulant child more than a brother-in-arms.

Nehandrah's speech comes to a close with "when the black hearts of men desire our palace in the Aether, do not weep, for you have brought this upon yourself."

Scene end

The sun was setting; rays of orange, yellow, and deeper golds spread across the skyline. A deeper red sash adorned the horizon, a borderline against the open expanse of low-lying green and brown razorgrasses that continued for what seemed like an infinity in every direction. There were small, stout trees, with wide canopies and thick trunks. Each tree had roots that extended far, far into the ground, an evolutionary mechanism originating from the stormlands out east. The wood of the trees was porous and soft, allowing the organism to be waterlogging for months at a time, a safety for dry seasons. Natives to this area would use special knives with holes bored through their blades to extract this water; most would recieve such a knife upon adulthood as a sort of coming-of-age rite. These natives, long ago, were nomads. They roamed the razorgrass plains, following herds of prey parallel to the various rivers of the area. Slowly, as new technologies began to filter into the area like agriculture and metallurgy, the natives began to form cities. First, they were small, little more than farming villages. Then, with this new abundance of easier food, the population exploded, and villages became towns, became cities, became a nation. The Thessalians. They named themselves for the river through their heartlands, _Thessa'ni_. Their people became great, and, slowly, their people became militaristic. Their training and their soldiers, now feared around the continent, were some of the very first to become professional. Where they went, others followed. Their techniques became standard, their standards became legendary. For half a millenia, the Thessalians threatened the independence of every nation with the mistfortune of bordering them. For half a millenia, the Thessalians _thrived_.

And then, it was over. In the span of little over a half a decade, the Thessalian military collapsed under its own weight; the previously fractured nations in the north, which had been a disjointed confederacy for generations, unified as if mortar had been poured in their cracks. A great leader rose amongst them, and before the Thessalians could quash the threat, the northern military rivalled their own. This gave pause to the generals of Thessali, and their drawn-out deliberations&mdash;alongside the pax that sometimes accompanies such deliberations&mdash;quickly cost the Thessalians the depth of their coffers. Their military was supremely expensive, and without spoils and conquest to supplement the Thessalian treasury, wages could not be paid. As most professional soldiers would agree, without wages there are no soldiers. The Thessalian dominance crumbled; the new power was the hungry confederacy in the north. Thessali lost land, and their previous "heartlands" bisected by the Thessa'ni river became their northernmost border. The river discouraged further advancement from the attackers, and there were many more tantalizing and poorer-fortified targets to the east and far north. Then, they were forgotten. They were reduced to a backwater. They were reduced to a shadow. They were reduced to a wilderness. The previously nationalistic fervor of the Thessalian people was forgotten, left to the history books kept in more enlightened places. For two thousand nine hundred and thirty-two years, this is what the Thessalians were.

Until the whispers of the Unification began. A new ruler, they said, inspired and visited by the Red Prophets themselves. He was raising a force to rival any other. Stories from the east told of slain soldiers risen on the battlefield, of shamans casting spells to split a man in half vertically.
