A People Torn Asunder

Two men stood atop a temple built in their honor, and a city burned at their feet. Tyrr, the greatest city of the South, with its even and maintained promenades and bustling markets, _burned_. The horrific screams of the dying filled the streets as bands of combatants&mdash;city defenders, looters, invaders, what difference remained?&mdash;roamed. The last of the city guard, a man named Hin, died at the hands of a looter just four blocks from the temple. His blood ran through the cobblestones as his wife huddled their children into a crawlspace in their tenement not even two hundred paces from the scene. Smoke filled the air as the renowned Tyrr library, full of books and knowledge and passion, burned to the ground, its tranquil halls now echoing with the sobs of people trapped inside. The city had fallen nearly six hours ago, but the carnage was far from over. The fire would burn until the next morning, at the approximate same time as a messenger would reach the king of Thesseli to bring the news; their greatest city save their capital was no more.

The two men saw this. Stretching out before them, ghostly possibilities of what could have been, what has been, and what will be. An empty field, hundreds of years ago, before this land was settled. Long before that, a lava flow from a volcano that had been the holy site of a people long forgotten. In the far future, another city, budding from the ruins of this one. All that had been, all that will be. And yet, despite the possibilities and the cold, passionless timeline they were being given of this city, the two men _felt_. To an extent, they felt the pain radiating from the people below. No matter how many futures they saw of another sprawling metropolis, there was always a sobbing mother or a crying son to offset it.

The one on the left, a tall, dark-skinned man with a hairless head and powerful build, began to weep. His eyes were a stormy grey, and adorning his clothing of green cloth were crystals of the same shade. A glyph was painted on his forehead in the same green as his robes, it seemed to glow faintly even beyond the light of the massive sun high above and the terrible fires down below. The man watched as a small group of fifteen or twenty men pulled a statue of his visage from a pedestal and then devolved into a brawl over the gold decorating it.
