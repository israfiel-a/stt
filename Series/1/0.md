## Bloodletter: The Last Return

Mihr is an endless cycle. Restoration and destruction, Opportunity and failure. Opposite forces battling in futility for control as the eons slip by. Mighty gales and the mountains they break upon, beaches of soft sand and the ships dashed upon them. An _exceedingly_ old planet, a planet whose surface has seen the foundations and destructions of empire innumerable. A planet which has seen the deaths and births of a dozen gods. A planet whose surface seems to stretch on infinitely, each continent practically a world in its own right. Hundreds of millions of people, thousands of languages and tens of thousands of cultures. Even the name "Mihr" is not ubiquitous; the mountain peoples to the North call their lands _K’yavjilakh_, "Fervent Storm," as they see mighty typhoons breaking on the slopes of their mountains. To the far West, they use the word _Fenhelam_, meaning "Third Daughter," in reference to the twin suns high in the heavens. Neither of these two peoples have ever made contact with one another, for there is a great ocean between them, but they share the same planet, they see the same stars, they collect the same resources.

However, on the coast of the continent the mountain peoples call their home, there is another culture. Those who left the mountains many centuries ago, seeking to find their own way. Those who endured storm and flood, those who endured famine and fire. Those who find their home amongst the scraggly foothills, where Mihr itself tries its very hardest to rip them from its surface. Every summer, typhoons thunder across the land, ripping trees from their roots and collapsing cliff sides. Many places are entirely unsuitable for agriculture; the fertility has simply been stripped away after millions of violent storms. And, despite all, humanity always seems to find a way to worm into where they are unwanted. Such are the people of Tekna'li Akih. The Akih are a hardy people. Ruled by a mighty Imperial family situated in the coastal city of Teyuri, their administration is tight and unwavering, determined to render the blunders of their ancestors impossible. Their population is truly mammoth, far into the upper bounds of ten million. However, the vast majority of their populace are lowly farmers, working to supply the Empire’s forces with food and other necessities. These farmers are themselves much beneath the Emperor, more similar to feudal servants. They're usually handled by inconsequential nobles below the right of even a true title, who are in turn handled by nobles less inconsequential and less inconsequential until you reach the Emperor. Many nobles families declare themselves a "house", which is the same in all but name to a vassal nation of the Empire. Each house typically has some kind of internal hierarchy, be it in the same structure as the Empire's, a pseudo-republic as some in the east of the Empire have, or some other system; the Akih are nothing without their order. In return for taxes and fealty, the Emperor allows them near total autonomy, free to clash with their neighbors and claim land as they wish. On more than one occasion, such a house has brought fortune and fame their way by expanding the Empire's borders through conquest of smaller nations or untamed wilderness. It is an arrangement that benefits noble and Empire significantly; the nobles retain autonomy, the Empire retains control.

This is where we shall begin, far beneath the grand machinations of the Imperial court. A noble house called Culiph has carved an estate for themselves amongst the relatively arable flatlands to the northeast of the Empire, allowing them to collect exorbitant tariffs on goods entering through the Elathm river. This has made them rich indeed, and their lands now stretch some five hundred kilometers inland from the coast of the Great Sea. However, even below the Highlord of Culiph, there are its daughter branches, smaller houses that pay fealty to Culiph rather than the Empire. One of these branches is called Amh. They possess an especially arable estate, and as such are incredibly reliant on agriculture. Nearly all of their lands are acreages, with villages sprinkled between and a single city. They specialize in a squat, robust crop called spikeweed, perfect for the unpredictable maritime climate they exist in. But even despite its ruggedness, spikeweed isn't invincible, and in recent months even this juggernaut had begun to falter. The summer had been merciless, twin suns beating down ferociously on the fields. Water had begun to dry with haste and plants began to wilt and die. This was called a Twofold Summer, when both suns are aligned in summertime–and this spelled famine for the Amh, and the wider Empire as a whole. Nearly half of their total grain and fruit production came from Culiph, and if a crop failed, it would not be pretty. This year's crop had failed. Terribly. Nearly half of all the plants seeded this year had died, and tithes and taxes to those above them still required a payment. Their own estate militia also had to be paid and equipped. Import taxes were extreme, imposed by the Ral estate situated directly in the delta to Amh's west. The Amh had expected a decree from their Highlord, that in order to keep the Empire whole the Ral must lower taxes. But, strangely, one had never come. The Highlord remained silent. The Twofold Summer was in its peak now, and damage was already done. The Amh lord had begun falling back on stored rations to feed his soldiers, and his slaves got less than half of what already meager sustenance they had been afforded. No soul was left unscathed; man, woman, nor child. But the slaves certainly felt it the worst. Expectations to work interminable hours tending to crops or building infrastructure, the ever-present heat, and food now far too miniscule to sustain them, all of it came at a horrifying cost. All but the lord’s favorites had become emaciated over the months of calamity, and _many_ had perished. All now worked with less vim, and not just simply because they were fatigued of the labor. Their very souls were running on fumes.
	
This decrease in productivity, however, greatly displeased the lord. He saw it not as a consequence of his policies, but as an _affront_ to his policies. The slaves were his property, they should do what he says, regardless of their starvation! And so he spared not one thought of empathy with the dead and dying working in his fields. Despite the lack of proper trade in Amh province, the slave trade was mostly conducted over land, facilitated by wandering slave caravans. The caravans continued to come, and as long as wars were being fought, slaves were cheap. And so, if one died it caused no real interruption. _But_, should a soldier die, it would take months to replace them. Training, equipment, pension&mdash;all at the cost of many resources. Slaves that worked less would produce less, and without proper food and pay for their troops, a lord’s livelihood was at stake. Petty squabbles among small lords had become increasingly common as of late. It was not uncommon for entire properties to be conquered in less than a month. The Highlord usually expressed his disapproval, but never directly stepped in, so long as his borders were secure and his taxes paid, it mattered not to him who paid nor protected them. But recently, even his disapproval was no longer expressed. It seemed to the smaller lords as if the old Highlord's will was wearing weak, and they pushed their advantage. New land was acquired, new alliances were made. New wars, new squabbles, new politics. And so, as these things go, the lords were perpetually paranoid of attack. In their minds, an impressive standing militia must be maintained, lest their weakness be exploited by an opponent. The slave lives spent in order to maintain this might were inconsequential&mdash;their sacrifice was for the greater good. In the lord’s mind, at least. The slaves, rightly, did not share such a viewpoint. The callousness of their treatment was not lost on them, but many of their number were dead or dying. _All_ of their number were starving. Their situation was entirely hopeless when any resistance was compared to the better-fed and better-equipped soldiers employed by their respective lords. Even the young among them, typically much more prone to acting rashly, understood this. And so they worked. Worked under the harsh twin suns, pulling spikefruit from the bush and enduring the violent tempers of their overseers. Because they could do nothing. Not without a miracle.
