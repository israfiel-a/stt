Bloodletter: History Forgets, Humanity Repeats

Mihr is an endless cycle. Restoration and destruction, opportunity and failure. Opposite forces battling in futility for control as the eons slip by. Mighty gales and the mountains they break upon, beaches of soft sand and the ships dashed upon them. An exceedingly old planet, a planet whose surface has seen the foundations and destructions of empires innumerable. A planet carved from the death of a god, maintained by the lives of others. A planet whose surface seems to stretch on infinitely, each continent practically a world in its own right. Hundreds of millions of people, thousands of languages and tens of thousands of cultures. Even the name "Mihr" is not ubiquitous; the mountain peoples to the North call their lands _K’yavjilakh_, "Fervent Storm," as they see mighty typhoons breaking on the slopes of their mountains. To the far West, they use the word _Fehalam_, meaning "Third Daughter," in reference to the twin moons visible in the dead of night. Neither of these two peoples have ever made contact with one another, for there is a great ocean between them, but they share the same planet, they see the same stars, and they collect the same resources.

And they have many, many stories. Every culture, every village, every person, has a story to tell. A history to learn, customs to keep, and rituals to carry out. When one sits at the base of a tree during the fall months, when the winds are blowing and the leaves turn vibrant colors, a whisper of one such story may be heard. A rush of a vowel, the breeze of a consonant. No more, no less. It leaves you wondering _What else?_ What else is the wind seeking to share? What else is there to learn? The older an object is, the more stories it tends to tell, for the older objects have the oldest gods. The grooves in a boulder worn away by rain over the course of millennia, mapping the changes in rainfall over more time than any civilization has existed. The dips in a plain where old lakes used to lie, ancient fossils petrified in their beds. The valleys between mountains, telling of a cliff collapse ten thousand years ago. The mountains do tend to tell the most stories; their god has always been a talkative man, if you know how to initiate. The oceans collect the most, of course, but their god is dead, and so they remain quiet. But the mountains _want_ to share. When human society spun to life all those thousands of years ago, they listened to the mountains, and they worshipped them. They were given shelter amongst their valleys, between their passes and beneath their overhangs. Humanity kept their knowledge through grooves in the stone, unyielding records that will remain for a fifty thousand years. However, even the mountains cannot tell all, and humanity seeks to know that which it does not. But the god of the mountains knew that some knowledge causes more harm than good. His children were numerous, and he sent his favorite amongst them to rile up the winds, harness the oceans, and thunder across the plains. He knew the destruction this would cause; but he was Divine, and could see the damage humanity would bring if left to their own devices. The god apologized to his brother in the plains and sent the storm. Humanity saw this and they were afraid, terrified of leaving their sanctuary in the mountains. The god knew this was a temporary fix, of course, as curiosity can only be restrained for so long before it explodes. His ideas were numerous but fleeting, often flawed in the way that only frantic reasoning can be. The centuries slipped by, and soon the god of the mountains was embroiled in a conflict beyond human comprehension. 

And in his absence, humanity _learned_.

A group began to extract precious stones from the mountain faces, and all negotiations were off. A child of the mountain god, she who was left as caretaker, became enraged. _How could her father's people do this? How could they destroy his glorious domain?_ And because she was lesser, she could not see the possibilities in the way her father did. She reacted violently. Frost set in, cliff sides collapsed. The mountains, roaring to action after all they had endured, tried their hardest to throw off the wicked parasites that dug ever deeper into their surface. The humans fought viciously for a long time. The mountains were all they had ever known, how could they leave? But some saw the greenery of the forests far below between storms, a far cry from their hellscape, and they yearned to know what was held within. Like before, their desire turned into a need, turned into _action_. Down the mountainside they went, into that which was previously unfamiliar and terrifying. Into naive, kind forests that opened their arms, welcomed the parasites into the fold. As their mines grew dusty and collapsed way up on the mountainsides, the humans forgot. They forgot the stories held within the mountains, within the world around them. They forgot all they could learn by just _listening_. The god of the mountains is chained now, his selfless sacrifice protecting humanity above from torture they could not even begin to imagine. He never knew their betrayal, and even if he did, they are his people. He loves them dearly, despite their faults. And despite his absence, his chambers in the realm of gods growing colder every century, his dominion still seeks to share. A whisper here, a syllable there. Stories waiting to be told.

But the only ones still listening are those amongst the humans who stayed in the mountains, all those years ago. The traditionalists, the faithful. They believe their god will one day return for them. They still worship the stone, but even they have forgotten many of the mountains' stories. They do not extract minerals, they shun metal. They may not remember why, but they see what metal represents. Destruction, violent progress. A path one cannot turn back from. They teach of compassion and of respect for that which is around you, for it has existed before and will exist after you. Because of their natural defenses, the mountain people have never needed to war. Their society is simple, robust, and calm. They seek to maintain what they have, instead of consuming what they want. But this lifestyle can be difficult, and while it seems peaceful whilst the times are good, when the worst takes its course the first thing to be blamed is meekness. A particularly freezing year arrives, and dissenters begin to grow as children and the elderly cling to life through the cold, shivering around fires that seem to grow ever colder. _We must expand!_ they say, _Our traditions bring ruin!_ They do not realize how their plans have been tried, and failed, before. Their histories do not go back that far, they have forgotten the very _why_ to their customs. They only see their own short-term pain, and so devise a permanent solution, one that will prove to cause more anguish than it could have ever solved. To leave. Go down the mountains, enter the forests. Make for the coasts. They do calculations, they write maps based off of the work of small scouting parties. _The storms do not strike the coasts!_ They are so confident, so unable to see their mistake. 

They are ignorant to the terrestrial concepts of typhoon seasons; in the high mountain sanctuary they call home, they have little knowledge of even the climatic idea of a "season". They do not know of the dangers in the stormplains below, they do not know of the hundreds of millions of people that were once just as they are. They do not know of how _dangerous that fact is_. They only see greener pastures, and do not stop for even a moment to consider; they are resolved. A scouting party leaves at the very end of summer in the lowlands, when the typhoons end. Pure chance convinces them it's safe on the stormplains. And so they strike off. They leave behind grandparents and stubborn peers, elders and leaders and role models. Their ancestral and childhood homes. Never to return, not even a single person. They leave behind their culture, their people, and become anew. They become the _Akih_. Those who endured storm and flood, those who endured famine and fire. Those who find their home amongst the scraggly plains and the sharp coasts, where Mihr itself tries its very hardest to rip them from its surface. Every summer, when typhoons thunder across the land, ripping trees from their roots and collapsing cliff sides, the Akih remain. Many places in their lands are entirely unsuitable for agriculture; the fertility has simply been stripped away after millions of violent storms, all that remains being a layer of sheer rock and the occasional supernaturally stubborn shrub. Despite all, humanity always seems to find a way to worm into where they are unwanted. Such are these people of Tekna'li Akih.

They are ruled by a mighty Imperial family situated in the coastal city of Teyuri. Their administration is tight and unwavering, for their ancestors' miscalculation has created for them an all-out struggle for survival. Their population, nearly two thousand years after they left their mountains, is truly mammoth, far into the upper bounds of ten million. However, the vast majority are lowly farmers, working to supply the Empire’s forces with food and other necessities. These farmers are themselves much beneath the Emperor, more similar to feudal servants. They're usually handled by inconsequential nobles below the right of even a true title, who are in turn handled by nobles less inconsequential and less inconsequential until you reach the Emperor. Many nobles families declare themselves a "house", which is the same in all but name to a vassal nation of the Empire. Each house typically has some kind of internal hierarchy, be it in the same structure as the Empire's, a pseudo-republic as some in the East have, or some other system; the Akih are nothing without their order. In the years after their exodus, their order became their only saving grace. In the generations that forgot about the mountains, their order became all they knew. In return for taxes and fealty, the Emperor allows noble houses near total autonomy, free to clash with their neighbors and claim land as they wish. On more than one occasion, such a house has brought fortune and fame their way by expanding the Empire's borders through conquest of the occasional smaller foreign nation or untamed wilderness. It is an arrangement that benefits noble and Empire simultaneously; the nobles retain autonomy, the Empire retains control.

This is where we shall begin, far beneath the grand machinations of the Imperial court. A noble house called Culiph has carved an estate for themselves amongst the relatively arable flatlands to the northeast of the Empire, allowing them to collect exorbitant tariffs on goods entering through the Elathm river. This has made them rich indeed, and their lands now stretch some five hundred kilometers inland from the coast of the Great Sea. However, even below the Highlord of Culiph, there are its daughter branches, smaller houses that pay fealty to Culiph rather than the Empire. One of these branches is called Amh. They possess an especially arable estate, and are as such incredibly reliant on agriculture. Nearly all of their lands are acreages, with villages sprinkled between and a single city. They specialize in a squat, robust crop called spikeweed, perfect for the unpredictable maritime climate they exist in. But even despite its ruggedness, spikeweed isn't invincible, and in recent months even this juggernaut had begun to falter. The summer had been merciless, twin suns beating down ferociously on the fields. Water had begun to dry with haste and plants began to wilt and die. This was called a Twofold Summer, when both suns are aligned in summertime–and this spelled famine for the Amh, and the wider Empire as a whole. Nearly half of their total grain and fruit production came from Culiph, and if a crop failed, it would not be pretty. This year's crop had failed. Terribly. Nearly half of all the plants seeded this year had died, and tithes and taxes to those above them still required a payment. Their own estate militia also had to be paid and equipped. Import taxes were extreme, imposed by the Ral estate situated directly in the delta to Amh's west. The Amh had expected a decree from their Highlord, that in order to keep the Empire whole the Ral must lower taxes. But, strangely, one had never come. The Highlord remained silent. The Twofold Summer was in its peak now, and damage was already done. The Amh lord had begun falling back on stored rations to feed his soldiers, and his slaves got less than half of what already meager sustenance they had been afforded. No soul was left unscathed; man, woman, nor child. But the slaves certainly felt it the worst. Expectations to work interminable hours tending to crops or building infrastructure, the ever-present heat, and food now far too miniscule to sustain them, all of it came at a horrifying cost. All but the lord’s favorites had become emaciated over the months of calamity, and _many_ had perished. All now worked with less vim, and not just simply because they were fatigued of the labor. Their very souls were running on fumes.
	
This decrease in productivity, however, greatly displeased the lord. He saw it not as a consequence of his policies, but as an _affront_ to his policies. The slaves were his property, they should do what he says, regardless of their starvation! And so he spared not one thought of empathy with the dead and dying working in his fields. Despite the lack of proper trade in Amh province, the slave trade was mostly conducted over land, facilitated by wandering slave caravans. The caravans continued to come, and as long as wars were being fought, slaves were cheap. And so, if one died it caused no real interruption. _But_, should a soldier die, it would take months to replace them. Training, equipment, pension&mdash;all at the cost of many resources. Slaves that worked less would produce less, and without proper food and pay for their troops, a lord’s livelihood was at stake. Petty squabbles among small lords had become increasingly common as of late. It was not uncommon for entire properties to be conquered in less than a month. The Highlord usually expressed his disapproval, but never directly stepped in, so long as his borders were secure and his taxes paid, it mattered not to him who paid nor protected them. But recently, even his disapproval was no longer expressed. It seemed to the smaller lords as if the old Highlord's will was wearing weak, and they pushed their advantage. New land was acquired, new alliances were made. New wars, new squabbles, new politics. And so, as these things go, the lords were perpetually paranoid of attack. In their minds, an impressive standing militia must be maintained, lest their weakness be exploited by an opponent. The slave lives spent in order to maintain this might were inconsequential&mdash;their sacrifice was for the greater good. In the lord’s mind, at least. The slaves, rightly, did not share such a viewpoint. The callousness of their treatment was not lost on them, but many of their number were dead or dying. _All_ of their number were starving. Their situation was entirely hopeless when any resistance was compared to the better-fed and better-equipped soldiers employed by their respective lords. Even the young among them, typically much more prone to acting rashly, understood this. And so they worked. Worked under the harsh twin suns, pulling spikefruit from the bush and enduring the violent tempers of their overseers. Because they could do nothing. Not without a miracle.
