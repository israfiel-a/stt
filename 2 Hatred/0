The angel knelt amongst the fronds. His wings were torn and bloodied, His robes ripped and soiled. Red-gold ichor flowed from a half dozen wounds, the worst of which included a hole directly through His abdomen. Held loosely in His grasp was His sword, of a translucent white material that seemed to catch the sun in its grasp. The angel looked towards the sun one last time, and collapsed in the dirt. A great golden glow enveloped His body, and it disappeared, leaving only his sword.
